overall: using nothing but a GUI, build an interactive educational diagram

subproblems:
  * runtime:
    ** prerequisites:
      *** needs graphics
      *** needs interaction
      *** needs domain-specific calculations
    ** solution:
      *** graphics/object library
      *** simple point primitive for interaction
        **** new problem: how to sensibly propagate user input?
      *** domain-specific computation libraries:
        **** dataflow expressions
        **** iterative update expressions
        **** new problem: how to sensibly propagate domain-specific input?

      *** linear constraints handle user/DS input

  * frontend:
    ** graphical editor for shapes
      *** expand...why is it good?
    ** synthesis of complicated components:
      *** interactions: given an IP,





    * rework ELA algorithm: formulation with two FVs in each equation is not
      always correct: e.g. consider a spring with points on end, middle.



        TOP = BOT + DY
        MID = BOT + DY/2


        a correct assignment is {DY, TOP, MID}...an incorrect one (that ELA likes)
        is {BOT, DY}

        so instead of a FV set, we want sources and sinks:

        starting from a seed set of source variables:
          * a configuration is **consistent** if every equation has either one source + sink
            OR no sources or sinks
          * associate configurations with colorings (a map from equation to empty/Source/Source + Sink).
            a candidate:
              ** lives in a equation with a Source
              ** is not a Source/Sink in another equation
            foreach candidate:
              ** add the candidate to the configuration
              ** color the candidate as a Sink in the other equations


        claim: given a consistent starting mapping of variables, the sources+sinks FV
        algorithm will result in a system that has a consistent mapping.

        PF: the



        or equation rewriting! pivot about free-variable (DY) gives:
        DY= TOP - BOT
        MID = BOT + (TOP - BOT)/2

        not clear why this works...
