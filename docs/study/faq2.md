Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
========

What am I doing?
-------
You're using EDDIE to replicate the interactive movement of several diagrams.

In this interface, you're manipulating the shapes in the Editor pane (on the left)
to match the movement of the interaction displayed in the Preview pane (on the right).

The preview on the right goes from left-to-right. The green dot in the Editor pane on the
left starts on the left -- your goal is to demonstrate the diagram's reaction when the
green dot goes from left-to-right.

How do I manipulate shapes?
-------
You can translate shapes by left-clicking and dragging in the editor pane.
You can resize shapes by left-clicking and dragging on the corner of the object.

How do I replicate the interaction?
-------
Use the interface on the left to overlap the two green dots, while also demonstrating the diagram's reaction to the interaction. If shapes stay connected
in the previewed interaction, keep them connected in the Editor interface.

Everything is broken! How do I fix it?
-------
If EDDIE gets hard to use due to bugs, you can refresh the page.
