input:
parse file/take json -> AST with no links/equations/buffers
(syntax.JSTerms.scala, storage.Parser.scala)
=>
sanity phase: insert buffer between interactivity, domain-specific functions
  -> AST with buffers but no links/equations,
=>
synthesis: infer equations -> AST with no links
=>
optimization: simplify + canonicalize intermediate expressions -> AST with no links
(next phase is expensive, cut down in preparation)
=>
synthesis: query for links (foreach valid config, give candidates) -> full AST
=>
compile: return JScript program
