TODO:

  * add in scalatest testing framework + unit tests
  * add physics primitives to AST
  * restructor AST into

  * finish point generation
    ** add inequalities to enforce orientation
    ** add triangles
  * finish AST
    ** add plots
    ** add inequalities to expressions

  * make merging links more precise

  * convert current benchmarks (on benchmarking branch) to linear/nonlinear version
  * find more benchmarks
    ** http://www.malinc.se/math/
    ** JSXGraph
    ** my solar system

ranking:
  * interactions tend to be at connection points
  * penalty for shape w/o interactive components
  * filter out "functionally identical" diagrams...
    ** positional equivalence: all points are in same place + have same links

nonlinear synthesis:
  * after equational pass, FV choice is ambiguous
  * (even w/o it, FVs might be underspecified)
  * foreach valid configuration w.r.t initial FVs:
    ** spin off iframe with that configuration
    ** start simulation in that frame
    *** disable hoverover requirement...maybe. maybe precompute frames or something...

distinguish between recursive updates and nonlinear one-way constraints:
  * recursive update semantics are: take old values of variable references.
  * nonlinear semantics are: ignore cycles (i.e. eval each node exactly once),
                             update a la dataflow graph
  * extend values:
    ** CassValues
    ** DFValues
    ** interface:
      *** getValue
      *** suggestValue
      *** evaluate
    ** type system: DFValues can't appear in cass equations and vice versa
  * runtime semantics:
    ** interactions: suggestValue for x, y values. reevaluate both networks.
