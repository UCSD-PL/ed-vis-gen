TODO:

  * debug duplicate programs... wtf???
  * filter out weird configs...
  * look at clash



  * finish point generation
    ** add inequalities to enforce orientation
    ** add triangles
  * finish AST
    ** add plots
    ** add inequalities to expressions

  * make merging links more precise

  * convert current benchmarks (on benchmarking branch) to linear/nonlinear version
  * find more benchmarks
    ** http://www.malinc.se/math/
    ** JSXGraph
    ** my solar system

ranking:
  * interactions tend to be at connection points
  * domain specific knowledge:
    ** boxes tend to be translated
    ** springs only stretch in y dimension
    ** dimensions don't mix in same point
  * penalty for shape w/o interactive components
  * filter out "functionally identical" diagrams...
    ** positional equivalence: all points are in same place + have same links
